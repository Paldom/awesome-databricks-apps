## TL;DR (fast checklist)

* ‚úÖ **One link per PR.** Keep changes focused and easy to review.
* ‚úÖ **Scope:** Only add items that directly help people **build, run, or operate Databricks Apps** (apps that run on the Databricks platform).
* ‚úÖ **Place it in the most specific section** (see section map below).
* ‚úÖ **Use the standard entry format** and **one‚Äësentence description**:
  `- [Name](URL) - Sentence starts with a capital and ends with a period.`
* ‚úÖ **No duplicates.** Search the list first.
* ‚úÖ **Sort alphabetically within a subsection** unless the subsection explicitly mirrors upstream ‚Äúofficial‚Äù ordering.
* ‚úÖ **Use canonical URLs** (no tracking params; prefer the project‚Äôs GitHub repo when appropriate).
* ‚úÖ **Run the linter locally:** `npx awesome-lint` and fix all findings before opening your PR. 
* ‚úÖ **PR title:** `Add: ProjectName`.
* ‚úÖ By contributing, you agree your contribution is released under **CC0‚Äë1.0** (public domain).

## What belongs here (acceptance criteria)

An item is in‚Äëscope if it directly supports **Databricks Apps** developers or operators:

* **Official Docs, Templates & Samples:** Canonical documentation or templates from Databricks.
* **Products Hosted on Databricks:** Full apps/tools that are actually deployed as **Databricks Apps** (prefer open source repos).
* **Demo Apps / Starters / Solution Accelerators:** Minimal or focused examples that demonstrate Databricks Apps features (auth, OBO, data access, Genie, MLflow, Lakehouse access, etc.).
* **Tooling/SDKs/CLIs/Libraries:** Client tools that materially improve developing, deploying, or operating Databricks Apps.
* **Tutorials/Guides/Use cases/Blogs:** Learning resources that show *how to* build/operate Databricks Apps end‚Äëto‚Äëend (not generic Databricks content).

> Tip: Databricks Apps are first‚Äëclass apps you deploy *on* the Databricks platform (not just code that uses Databricks APIs). Keep submissions focused on this modality. 

### Out of scope

* Generic data/AI articles that don‚Äôt meaningfully involve **Databricks Apps**.
* Closed, marketing‚Äëonly pages without a repo or substantive build/run instructions.
* Dead/unmaintained projects without a working demo/readme.
* Duplicates of items already in the list.
* Content that‚Äôs primarily about a different product/platform.

---

## Where should my item go?

Use the **most specific** section. If it fits multiple, pick the one that best matches *why* someone would use it.

* **Official Docs & Product Overview** ‚Üí Official product pages & docs.
* **Official Templates & Samples** ‚Üí Databricks‚Äëmaintained templates/samples. Keep the upstream order for the per‚Äëframework ‚Äúofficial‚Äù subsections.
* **Products Hosted on Databricks** ‚Üí Full apps running as Databricks Apps.
* **Demo Apps** ‚Üí Self‚Äëcontained demos of capabilities.
* **Starter Repositories** ‚Üí Boilerplates that scaffold Databricks Apps.
* **Solution Accelerators** ‚Üí Industry/use‚Äëcase focused kits.
* **Resources** ‚Üí Documentation, related services (e.g., Unity Catalog, MLflow), tooling/SDKs/CLI, tutorials, use cases, blogs, community.

If you believe a **new subsection** is warranted, propose it in the PR description and include at least **3‚Äì5 strong items** to justify the new category.

---

## Entry format & style

Use exactly this bullet style:

```md
- [Project Name](https://example.com) - One concise sentence that starts with a capital letter and ends with a period.
```

**Rules**

* **Sentence case & period:** Start with a capital letter, end with a period. The linter checks this. 
* **Keep it concise:** One sentence. Avoid marketing, superlatives, and emojis. Explain *what it is/does* and *why it‚Äôs useful*.
* **Canonical links:** Prefer the project homepage or GitHub repo. Remove tracking parameters.
* **Ordering:** Alphabetical within a subsection (except where noted above for ‚ÄúOfficial‚Äù upstream lists).
* **One link per item:** If you must include alternates (docs/demo), link the primary and mention others succinctly in the description only when necessary.

**Good**

```md
- [FastAPI Starter](https://github.com/Paldom/databricks-apps-fastapi-starter) - Boilerplate that scaffolds a FastAPI-based Databricks App with local dev and bundle deploy flows.
```

**Not good**

```md
- [Cool Starter!!!](https://example.com?utm=promo) - The best starter ever üî•üî•üî• for any cloud.
```

## How to contribute

1. **Fork** the repo and create a branch:
   `git checkout -b add-projectname`
2. **Edit `README.md`** and add your item in the correct section.
3. **Sort the subsection alphabetically** (unless it‚Äôs an ‚ÄúOfficial‚Äù ordered block).
4. **Run the linter** locally and fix all findings:

   ```bash
   npx awesome-lint
   ```

   * The linter enforces Awesome‚Äëstyle rules (badge, list marker style, trailing slash, **no dead URLs**, item formatting, etc.). You can temporarily disable a specific rule using special comments if truly necessary (see examples in the linter docs). 

   `git commit -m "Add: ProjectName"`
6. **Open a PR** with **one link only** and include:

   * Why this is valuable for **Databricks Apps** users.
   * Which section you chose and why.
   * Any caveats (e.g., alpha status).
7. (Nice‚Äëto‚Äëhave) Review another open PR and leave actionable feedback.

> CI runs `awesome-lint` on PRs (via GitHub Actions). Submissions must pass before merge.

## Quality bar (what maintainers look for)

* **Relevance:** It‚Äôs clearly about **Databricks Apps** (building, deploying, or operating apps on Databricks). 
* **Clarity:** A solid README with setup/run instructions; ideally a screenshot/GIF.
* **Health:** The repo looks maintained (recent commits/issues/releases).
* **Neutrality:** Minimal marketing; focus on facts and utility.
* **Curation:** Ask ‚Äúis it *awesome*?‚Äù Curate, don‚Äôt collect. It‚Äôs fine to leave mediocre items out. 

We may edit wording for brevity/consistency, move the item to a better section, or close the PR if it‚Äôs out of scope.
